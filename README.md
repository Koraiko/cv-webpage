# For Recruiters / HR
If you would like to **run this project locally** (a hosted version is planned for the future), please follow these steps:
1. Download the repository
    - Click the "Code" button (top-left above the file list) and select "Download ZIP".
2. Extract the ZIP file
3. Install Node.js
    - This project uses npm (Node Package Manager), which comes with Node.js. Installation is required to run the project locally.
4. Start the development server
    - Open a terminal in the project folder and run:
        - `npm install`: installs all necessary dependencies
        - `npm start`: starts the project
    - Your browser should open automatically. If not, visit http://localhost:3000.

**For Code Reviewers:**
You can explore the code directly here on GitHub. The most relevant files are located in:
- src/ – main project source code (WIP)
- public/ - static assets (e.g. images, css, text)

# TODO (management; not code)
- [ ] Write full README
- [ ] Add license
- [ ] remove unneeded npm imports

This repository is part of an ongoing portfolio project I'm building while job searching.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
