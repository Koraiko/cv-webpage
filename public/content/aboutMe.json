        "I'm a frontend developer with a focus on clean code, intuitive interfaces, and user-centered design. I enjoy working with modern tools like React and TypeScript and continuously aim to improve both user experience and code quality.",
        "My first attempts at HTML and CSS go back to high school — they sparked a curiosity that has stayed with me ever since. Since March 2023, I’ve been deepening my skills through university and personal projects using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript. Since October 2024, I’ve also been working with frameworks like React and Angular.",
        "I value clear structure, long-term maintainability, and continuous learning through practical experience – whether in collaborative projects or when improving existing systems. I’m particularly motivated by projects that combine well-structured code with a strong focus on user experience."
